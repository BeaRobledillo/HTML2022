        <h1>Re: Eileen Dover university application</h1>
        <p>Dear Eileen,</p>
        <p>
            Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of
            Awesome’s science faculty to study as part <br />
            of your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the
            following sections.
        </p>
        <h2>Starting dates</h2>
        <p>
            We are happy to accomodate you starting your study with us at any time,
            however it would suit us better if you <br />
            could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one
            are as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
            <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
            <li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Please let me know if this is ok. and if so which start date you would
            prefer.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can find more information about
            <a href="https://www.adelaide.edu.au/student/dates/" target="_blank">important university dates</a>
            on our website.
        </p>

        <h2>Subjects of study</h2>
        <p>
            At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research
            facility — as long as the subjects fall <br />
            somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an
            intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just <br />
            the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the
            ideas you submitted we were most intrigued <br />
            by are as follows, in order of priority:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of
                Rcsveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)
            </li>
            <li>
                Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplaycrs at tcmpraturcs
                exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the <br />
                audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 10<sup>3</sup> >
                3 x 10<sup>4</sup>.)
            </li>
            <li>HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects,
            including how long you'd expect the <br />
            research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else
            you think we'd need to know? Thanks.
        </p>

        <h2>Exotic dance moves</h2>
        <p>
            Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work. I
            <i>did</i> study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question, <br />
            my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:
        </p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
            <dd>
                A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC.
                a whole village would dance around <br />
                in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock or be
                "fruitful*.
            </dd>
            <dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt>
            <dd>
                Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they
                used to practice this dance, which <br />
                involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and
                shuffling their bodies around in impcrccptably <br />
                tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that
                he thought this dance inspired <br />
                modem styles such as Twerking.
            </dd>
            <dt>Arctic robot dance</dt>
            <dd>
                An interesting example of historic misinformation. English explorers
                in the 1960s believed to have <br />
                discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic*, stilted
                movements, being practiced by inhabitants <br />
                of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that
                they were just moving like this <br />
                because they were really cold.
            </dd>
        </dl>

        <p>
            For more of my research, see my <u>exotic dance research page.</u>
        </p>
        <p>Yours sincerely.</p>
